Electric load prediction using LSTM
This project forecasts electric load for a year using data from the previous years. It uses simple 4-stack LSTM to predict the output. The data is from 2015,2016, 2017 and 2018. We predict the data of 2018 using the previous 3 datas. It does not have lot of dependent variables, jsut a time series of the load usage of previous years. The pdf contains the report and the xls file contains the data
